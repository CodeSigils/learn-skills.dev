  Use this skill when the user is working with LyteNyte Grid (@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro
  or @1771technologies/lytenyte-core), a headless React data grid. Activate for tasks like:
  installing or licensing the grid, configuring columns or rows, building cell renderers or
  editors, adding filters or sort controls, grouping or aggregating rows, pivoting, exporting
  to CSV/Excel/Parquet/Arrow, row selection, cell range selection, theming or styling,
  TypeScript GridSpec patterns, server-side or tree data, and any PRO component (SmartSelect,
  PillManager, Menu, Dialog, TreeView, RowGroupCell). Also activate when the user describes
  grid problems without naming the package — e.g. "my rows won't group", "cells aren't
  editable", "add a loading overlay", "pin this column", "the filter isn't working",
  "how do I export this table", "select a range of cells", "copy cells to clipboard".
compatibility: React 18+. Designed for Claude Code and similar AI coding agents.

LyteNyte Grid is a headless React data grid with two editions:

- **Core** — `@1771technologies/lytenyte-core` (Apache 2.0, free, no license required)
- **PRO** — `@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro` (commercial, superset of Core)

**PRO licensing:** PRO can be installed and used freely for evaluation — no license key is needed to try it. A watermark ("used for evaluation") appears when no key is set. A license key is required to remove the watermark for **production deployments**. License validation is offline; no network request is made. If the user is building/prototyping and hasn't set up a license yet, that is fine — they can add it before shipping.

## Quick Start

```tsx
// or @1771technologies/lytenyte-core if already installed
import { Grid, useClientDataSource } from "@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro";
import "@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro/grid-full.css";

interface GridSpec {
  readonly data: { name: string; price: number };
}

function MyGrid() {
  const ds = useClientDataSource({ data: myData });
  const [columns, setColumns] = useState<Grid.Column<GridSpec>[]>([
    { id: "name", name: "Name" },
    { id: "price", name: "Price", type: "number" },
  ]);

  return (
    <div className="ln-light ln-grid" style={{ height: 500 }}>
      <Grid<GridSpec> rowSource={ds} columns={columns} onColumnsChange={setColumns} rowHeight={40} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Gotchas

- **`useState` and other locally created state are cleared when the user scrolls and rows are removed by virtualization**: Lift state into a React context or provide an `apiExtension`.
- **Memoize all non-primitive props**: `columns`, `columnBase`, `events`, `apiExtension`, etc. must be stable references (use `useMemo`/`useCallback`) or use the React Compiler. Inline objects cause full grid re-renders.
- **Pivoting requires `ds.usePivotProps()`** — calling `useClientDataSource` with `pivotMode: true` is not enough. You must also spread `ds.usePivotProps()` onto `<Grid />` or the grid will not render pivot columns.
- **Server source: `queryKey` change = full reset** — putting a sort/filter model in `queryKey` causes the grid to discard all loaded data and restart from row 0. This is intentional; use it to trigger refetches.
- **`rtl` prop required for RTL** — the grid does NOT detect RTL from the CSS `direction` property. Set `<Grid rtl />` explicitly.
- **CSP requires `style-src 'unsafe-inline'`** — LyteNyte Grid uses inline styles for layout/virtualization. Most modern frameworks (Vite, Next.js) already include this.
- **Column `id` is immutable** — never change a column's `id` after creation. It is used as a stable key throughout the grid.
- **`usePiece` for reactive extension state** — to expose reactive state through `apiExtension` (e.g., a filter model), wrap it in `usePiece(value, setter)`. Plain values in the extension object are not reactive.
- **Context menu: suppress browser default** — always call `event.preventDefault()` and `event.stopPropagation()` in `contextmenu` handlers, or the browser menu appears over yours.
- **Popover editors: disable `editOnPrintable`** — if your edit renderer uses character keys (e.g., a SmartSelect), set `editOnPrintable: false` on the column to prevent the grid from entering edit mode on every keypress.
- **The grid container must have a defined size** — the `<Grid />` component fills its parent 100%. If the parent has no explicit height, the grid renders with zero height and appears blank. Always set a fixed pixel height, or use a flex/grid layout with `flex: 1`.
- **CSS import is optional but required for the prebuilt themes** — LyteNyte Grid is headless by design. If you don't import the CSS, the grid renders functionally but with no built-in styles; you must supply your own via headless mode, Tailwind, CSS Modules, or Emotion. Only import the CSS if you want a prebuilt theme or the default styling.
- **`columns` always needs `onColumnsChange`** — omitting it means column resizes, reorders, and sort-state changes made by the user are silently discarded. The grid needs to call `setColumns` to persist any column mutation.

## Key Patterns

- **`GridSpec`** — define once per grid: `interface GridSpec { readonly data: MyType }`. Drives all types.
- **All filters are custom predicates** — `(row: RowLeaf<T>) => boolean`. No built-in filter UI.
- **`apiExtension`** — adds custom methods/state to the grid API. Use function form `(api) => ({...})` when the extension needs to call grid API methods.

## Load References On Demand

Read a reference file only when the task requires it. Do not load all files upfront.
