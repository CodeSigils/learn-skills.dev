# SKILL: CData CLI

## Data Model

The driver exposes the data source as a relational model:

- Tables that represent queriable entities
- Columns that make up the attributes of tables
- Procedures that support performing actions

---

## CLI Invocation

The CLI installs as `cdatacli` and is on `PATH` after install:

```bash
cdatacli <group> <subcommand> [options]
```

Requires Java 17+. Drivers are discovered from `./` or `./lib/` relative to the CLI executable.

> **Shell syntax:** Examples below use bash/zsh syntax. On Windows PowerShell, adapt them:
> - `mkdir -p <dir>` → `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force <dir>`
> - `\` line-continuation → backtick `` ` ``
> - `> file` writes UTF-16 on **Windows PowerShell 5.1**, which can corrupt a generated `SKILL.md`; use `| Out-File -Encoding utf8 file` instead (PowerShell 7+ already writes UTF-8).
> - Wrap a connection string in single quotes if it contains `$` or other characters the shell would expand.

If `cdatacli --version` is missing, install:

- Windows (PowerShell): `irm https://downloads.cdata.com/cdatabuilds/builds/free/cdatacli/install-cdatacli-windows.ps1 | iex`
- macOS: `curl -fsSL https://downloads.cdata.com/cdatabuilds/builds/free/cdatacli/install-cdatacli-macos.sh | bash`
- Linux: `curl -fsSL https://downloads.cdata.com/cdatabuilds/builds/free/cdatacli/install-cdatacli-linux.sh | bash`

## Source-Specific Skills

For popular sources, CData drivers ship source-specific instructions (connection patterns, schema notes, query examples). The driver must be installed first — this command reads the instructions bundled in the driver jar. Once it's installed, generate a ready-to-use skill with:

```bash
cdatacli drivers skill <Driver>
```

This prints a ready-to-use YAML skill frontmatter prefix (`name: cdata-<source>` plus a description) followed by the driver's source-specific instructions.

Save the output as a `SKILL.md` in **whichever directory the user's AI coding tool loads skills (or rules/instructions) from** — the right location depends on the tool and on the intended scope: **user-level** (available across all of the user's projects) or **project-level** (committed with a single project). Don't assume a fixed path. For example:

- **Claude Code:** `~/.claude/skills/cdata-<source>/SKILL.md` (user-level) or `.claude/skills/cdata-<source>/SKILL.md` (project-level)
- **Other agents** (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, Codex, etc.): use that tool's own skills/rules/instructions directory and file convention

If you're not sure where the current tool loads skills from, ask the user before writing the file. Then load the new skill for future work on that source. Example (replace `<skills-dir>` with the correct location for your tool):

```bash
mkdir -p <skills-dir>/cdata-<source>
cdatacli drivers skill <Driver> > <skills-dir>/cdata-<source>/SKILL.md
```

If the driver has no checked-in instructions, the command returns `No instructions available for <driver>` — in that case, proceed with the generic workflow below.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Get columns before querying** — use exact names from schema discovery.
2. **LIMIT first** — sample before full queries.
3. **[Bracket] table and column names** — handles reserved words and spaces.
4. **Filter before joining** — apply WHERE first, add JOINs one at a time.
5. **Date filters prevent timeouts** — large sources time out on unfiltered queries.
6. **Check procedures before concluding impossible** — file operations, bulk exports, auth flows are often stored procedures.
7. **Enum/picklist fields** — look for a dedicated table (e.g. `PickListValues`) before filtering. Don't guess values.

---

## Recommended Workflow

### Step 1: Ensure the CLI is Installed

Confirm the CLI is available before anything else:

```bash
cdatacli --version
```

If that fails (command not found), install it and then re-check `cdatacli --version`:

- Windows (PowerShell): `irm https://downloads.cdata.com/cdatabuilds/builds/free/cdatacli/install-cdatacli-windows.ps1 | iex`
- macOS: `curl -fsSL https://downloads.cdata.com/cdatabuilds/builds/free/cdatacli/install-cdatacli-macos.sh | bash`
- Linux: `curl -fsSL https://downloads.cdata.com/cdatabuilds/builds/free/cdatacli/install-cdatacli-linux.sh | bash`

The CLI requires Java 17+.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Goal

Confirm the **source** and **goal** (what to query or accomplish) before proceeding.

If a source-specific SKILL is already installed in the AI tool's skills directory (`cdata-<source>`), invoke it. Otherwise, **don't generate one yet** — `cdatacli drivers skill <Driver>` reads the instructions bundled in the driver jar, so it only works once the driver is installed. Wait until you've confirmed the driver is installed (Step 3), then run `cdatacli drivers skill <Driver>`: if it returns content, save it as a new skill in the location appropriate for the user's AI tool (see Source-Specific Skills above) and invoke it; if it returns `No instructions available for <driver>`, continue with the generic workflow.

---

### Step 3: Verify Driver is Available and Activated

```bash
cdatacli drivers list
```

If the driver appears with `"activated": true`, skip to Step 4. If the driver is missing, download it from the CData driver catalog:

```bash
cdatacli drivers search --driver <source>          # find the artifactId
cdatacli drivers download --artifact-id <id>       # downloads to ./lib by default
cdatacli drivers download --url <jar-url>          # alternative: direct URL
```

`drivers download` resolves the URL from CData's published `artifacts.json` catalog and writes the jar to `--output <dir>` (default `./lib/`) — the same location the CLI auto-discovers. Re-run `drivers list` to confirm discovery. As a manual fallback, place a CData JDBC JAR in `./` or `./lib/` next to the CLI executable.

#### Activate

> **⚠️ License-key notice — show this to the user before running `drivers activate --key`:**
>
> It is not recommended to paste a license key into this AI session. A `--trial` activation is safe to run here, but a purchased `--key` is a secret credential — anything typed into the session is visible to the AI and may be persisted in transcripts.
>
> If you need to activate with a purchased key, do it outside the AI session:
> - Run `cdatacli drivers activate <Driver> --name ... --email ... --key ...` in a non-AI terminal, or
> - Double-click `cdata.jdbc.<source>.jar` to activate via the GUI wizard.
>
> Once the driver is activated, the license is saved alongside the jar — `drivers list` will show `"activated": true` and no further activation is needed in the AI session.

**Ask before activating — don't default to a trial.** First ask the user whether they have a purchased license key or want a 30-day trial. Only run `--trial` if they confirm they don't have a key (or explicitly choose the trial); if they have a key, follow the license-key notice above rather than activating in this session.

The driver is a positional argument (e.g. `Salesforce`). `--name` and `--email` are the registrant's name and email — the individual registering the license. `--trial` requests a 30-day trial; `--key` activates a purchased license.

```bash
cdatacli drivers activate <Driver> --name "John Doe" --email "you@example.com" --trial
cdatacli drivers activate <Driver> --name "John Doe" --email "you@example.com" --key "XXXXX-XXXXX"
```

---

### Step 4: Check Connection Properties

If a saved connection already exists (`connection list`), confirm with the user they would like to use it. Otherwise, inspect the driver's connection properties to determine what credentials to ask for:

```bash
cdatacli drivers connectionprops <Driver>          # basic properties (default)
cdatacli drivers connectionprops <Driver> --full   # advanced properties instead
```

By default `connectionprops` returns the **basic** properties — the set most connections need. Have the user confirm the connection string before building the connection. If they need advanced properties not in the basic set, add `--full` to the `connectionprops` command.

Don't carry connection settings over from a previous connection or session into a new connection without acknowledging it to the user.

**Hierarchy rules** describe how properties depend on each other. A property's `hierarchyRules` is keyed by that property's possible values, and each key lists the properties that become relevant for that choice. For example, Salesforce's `AuthScheme` has rules for `Basic`, `OAuth`, `OAuthClient`, etc.: choosing `AuthScheme=Basic` surfaces `User` and `Password` (both `RequiredBasic`) plus `SecurityToken` (`UnrequiredBasic`). Use these rules to ask the user only for the properties that the chosen auth scheme actually requires.

Key properties across all sources:
- `AuthScheme` — OAuth, Basic, etc.
- `InitiateOAuth` — OFF, GETANDREFRESH, REFRESH
- `OAuthClientId` / `OAuthClientSecret` — for custom OAuth apps
- `OAuthSettingsLocation` — where OAuth tokens are cached

---

### Step 5: Create a Saved Connection

> **⚠️ Credential notice — show this to the user before running `connection create`:**
>
> It is not recommended to paste passwords, API tokens, or other secret credentials into this AI session. Even though `cdatacli connection create` will accept them in a connection string, anything typed here is visible to the AI and may be persisted in transcripts.
>
> **Recommended for AI-assisted use:**
> - `AuthScheme=OAuth` (embedded OAuth) — credentials never enter the connection string; the browser flow handles auth.
>
> **If your data source requires Basic / PAT / API-token auth, set up the connection outside the AI session:**
> - Run `cdatacli connection create ...` in a non-AI terminal, or
> - Double-click `cdata.jdbc.<source>.jar` to use the GUI setup wizard, or
> - Reuse a connection from a prior non-AI setup.
>
> Afterward, `cdatacli` uses the saved connection by name only — credentials never re-enter the terminal.

Confirm the (non-secret) connection string values with the user, then save:

```bash
cdatacli connection create --driver "<Driver>" --name "<connection-name>" \
  --connectionstring "<properties>"
```

Common patterns:

| Auth Type | Connection String |
|---|---|
| OAuth (browser flow) | `AuthScheme=OAuth;InitiateOAuth=GETANDREFRESH` |
| Basic (user/pass) | `AuthScheme=Basic;User=you@example.com;Password=pass` |
| API Token | `User=you@example.com;APIToken=yourtoken` |
| Read-only | Append `ReadOnly=true` to any connection string |

```bash
cdatacli connection list
cdatacli connection delete --name "<connection-name>"
```

Connections are saved as encrypted `.conn` files (AES-256):

| OS | Location |
|---|---|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\CData\<Driver Name> Data Provider\` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/CData/<Driver Name> Data Provider/` |
| Linux | `~/.config/CData/<Driver Name> Data Provider/` |

---

### Step 6: Discover Schema

```bash
cdatacli metadata tables --connection <name>
cdatacli query sql --connection <name> --sql "SELECT TableName, TableType, Description FROM sys_tables WHERE TableName LIKE '%<keyword>%'"
cdatacli metadata columns --connection <name> --table <TableName>
cdatacli metadata procedures --connection <name>
cdatacli metadata parameters --connection <name> --procedure <ProcedureName>
cdatacli metadata catalogs --connection <name>
cdatacli metadata schemas --connection <name>
```

Most `metadata` subcommands accept optional `--catalog` / `--schema` filters. `metadata tables` also takes a `--table` name pattern; `metadata columns` requires `--table` and accepts `--column`; `metadata procedures` accepts `--procedure`; `metadata parameters` requires `--procedure` and accepts `--parameter`.

Name patterns use `%` as a wildcard and are **case-insensitive**. A bare value is an **exact match** — `--table Order` returns only `Order`, not `OrderItem`; use `--table "%Order%"` to match substrings. `_` is treated literally (not a wildcard), so `--column "%__c"` matches Salesforce custom fields. Quote any pattern containing `%`.

---

### Step 7: Execute Queries

Use only column names confirmed by previous steps. Build incrementally.

`query sql` accepts these optional flags beyond `--connection` and `--sql`:

- `--timeout <seconds>` — query timeout (default `30`). Raise it for slow or large sources.
- `--max-rows <n>` — maximum rows returned **per result set** (default `1000`). Results are silently capped at this number, so a `SELECT *` on a larger table returns only the first 1000 rows unless you raise `--max-rows`. Use a SQL `LIMIT` to sample deliberately, and raise `--max-rows` when you need a full extract.
- `--metadata` — include the column schema (names, types) in the output. Omitted by default; add it only when you need column type information.

#### SELECT

```bash
cdatacli query sql --connection <name> --sql "SELECT * FROM [TableName] LIMIT 5"
cdatacli query sql --connection <name> --sql "SELECT [Id], [Name], [Status] FROM [TableName] WHERE [Status] = 'Active' LIMIT 10"
cdatacli query sql --connection <name> --sql "SELECT a.[Id], a.[Name], b.[Name] AS Related FROM [TableA] a LEFT JOIN [TableB] b ON a.[ForeignKey] = b.[Id] LIMIT 10"
```

**Reading the output.** `query sql` returns the same JSON shape for every data source (`--compact` only removes whitespace). By default the output contains only the data. The top-level shape depends on the query kind:

```json
// SELECT (one result set) — default:
{ "resultset": [ { "cnt": 368 } ] }

// SELECT with --metadata — adds a column-schema array:
{ "metadata": [ { "name": "cnt", "typeName": "INT", ... } ], "resultset": [ { "cnt": 368 } ] }

// INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE, or a statement that returns nothing:
{ "affectedRows": 3 }

// Multiple result sets (batch): each entry is one of the shapes above
{ "results": [ { "resultset": [...] }, { "affectedRows": 2 } ] }
```

- **Row data for a SELECT is always under `resultset`** — an array of row objects keyed by column name. To count rows, count the `resultset` array (above, 1 row whose `cnt` is 368). For batches, read `results[].resultset`.
- `metadata` (column names/types) is **omitted by default** and only appears when you pass `--metadata`; it's schema, not data, so ignore it when reading values.
- There is **no `rows` key**, for any source. A SELECT returned no data only when `resultset` is `[]`. Do not infer "0 rows" from a missing `rows` field, and do not assume the table name is wrong because you can't find row data — look under `resultset`.

Pipe to `jq` with `--compact`, reading rows from `.resultset`:

```bash
cdatacli query sql --connection <name> --sql "SELECT Id, Name FROM Account" --compact | jq '.resultset[].Name'
```

#### INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE

```bash
cdatacli query sql --connection <name> --sql "INSERT INTO [TableName] (Col1, Col2) VALUES ('val1', 'val2')"
cdatacli query sql --connection <name> --sql "UPDATE [TableName] SET [Col1] = 'new' WHERE [Id] = '123'"
cdatacli query sql --connection <name> --sql "DELETE FROM [TableName] WHERE [Id] = '123'"
```

If writes fail, the connection may have `ReadOnly=true`. Do not change this on your own — point it out to the user and ask whether they want to recreate the connection without `ReadOnly=true` before taking any action.

#### Stored Procedures

```bash
cdatacli query sql --connection <name> --sql "EXEC ProcedureName Param1='value1', Param2='value2'"
```

---

### Step 8: Generate Application Code

If the user's goal includes generating application code, use the validated SQL, driver path (from `drivers list`), and connection string to generate standalone code.

#### Driver Locations

**JDBC (Java):**
- Windows: `C:\Program Files\CData\CData JDBC Driver for <DataSource> <Year>\lib\cdata.jdbc.<datasource>.jar`
- macOS: `/Applications/CData/CData JDBC Driver for <DataSource> <Year>/lib/cdata.jdbc.<datasource>.jar`
- CLI-bundled: `./` or `./lib/cdata.jdbc.<datasource>.jar` next to the CLI executable
- Driver class: `cdata.jdbc.<source>.<Source>Driver`
- JDBC URL: `jdbc:<source>:<connection-string>`
- License file: same directory, `cdata.jdbc.<datasource>.lic`
