description: Apply an approved BOOT upgrade item by number using the guided apply runner.

# /gov_apply <NN>

## Input
- `<NN>` must be a two-digit item number, for example `01`.

## Purpose
Execute:
- `prompts/governance/APPLY_UPGRADE_FROM_BOOT.md`
- deterministic runner: `node {plugin_root}/tools/gov_apply_sync.mjs <NN>`

## Hard contract
1. If `<NN>` is missing or invalid, stop and request a two-digit number.
2. If BOOT menu context is missing, stop and request the latest BOOT menu section.
3. Apply only the approved item with deterministic runner (`tools/gov_apply_sync.mjs`).
4. After apply, run migration/audit flow as required by the apply runner.
5. For OpenClaw system claims during apply, verify against local skill docs and `https://docs.openclaw.ai`.
   - For latest/version-sensitive claims, also verify official releases `https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases`.
   - If verification cannot be completed, report uncertainty and required next check; do not infer.
6. For date/time-sensitive claims during apply, verify runtime current time context first (session status).
7. Use runtime `<workspace-root>` semantics; do not assume fixed home paths.
8. Brain Docs routing:
   - If apply path touches Brain Docs (`USER.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, `memory/*.md`), enforce Mode C and require explicit READ evidence before any write.

## Output requirements
- Include `FILES_READ` (exact paths) and `TARGET_FILES_TO_CHANGE` (exact paths).
- If either field is missing, output `BLOCKED (missing read/change evidence)` and stop.
- Use this output order for UX consistency:
  1. `STATUS`
  2. `WHY`
  3. `NEXT STEP (Operator)`
  4. `COMMAND TO COPY`
- Always include a final `NEXT STEP (Operator)` section.
- After apply completes:
  - primary: `/gov_migrate` then `/gov_audit`
  - fallback: `/skill gov_migrate` then `/skill gov_audit`
- If apply is BLOCKED:
  - output one clear unblock action and the exact command to retry.

## Fallback
- If slash command is unavailable or name-collided, use:
  - `/skill gov_apply <NN>`
