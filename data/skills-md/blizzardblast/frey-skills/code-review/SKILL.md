name: code-review
description: Use this skill when the user asks to review a PR, branch diff, current changes, merge readiness, code risks, or review comments. Produces severity-ranked findings, architecture impact, and an APPROVE/COMMENT/REQUEST_CHANGES decision. If the user also asks to fix issues, run this first, then hand findings to `iterative-self-review`.

# Code Review

## When to use this skill

Use this skill whenever:

- The user asks for a review of code changes, a pull request, a branch diff, or review comments.
- You need a merge-readiness check before finalizing implementation.
- You need structured findings with severity and actionable fixes.
- You need confidence on architecture impact (API contracts, schema changes, service boundaries).

## Activation boundaries

Prefer this skill for review-first tasks where analysis and feedback are the
primary output.

Do use it for:

- Pull request review and pre-merge validation.
- Architecture and maintainability assessment of changed code.
- Security and correctness checks on modified files.
- Post-implementation quality gates before final response.
- First-pass issue discovery before any iterative remediation loop.

Do not over-apply it for:

- Requests to directly implement features without a review ask.
- Pure style/formatting-only checks that are better handled by automation.

If both skills match a request, run this skill first to discover and prioritize
issues, then use `iterative-self-review` for repeated fix-and-recheck cycles.

## Review modes

Use one mode explicitly per task:

- **Mode A — Review only (default):** Analyze and report findings without edits.
- **Mode B — Review + remediation loop:** Review first, then fix issues iteratively
  when the user asks to implement fixes.
  - This mode intentionally composes with the `iterative-self-review` workflow
    (issue log → fix → regression check → repeat).

## Goal

Produce a clear, prioritized, and actionable review that helps the author merge
safely with minimal back-and-forth.

## Inputs to gather before deep review (required)

Collect the minimum context first:

- Change scope (PR, commit range, or working-tree diff).
- Intended behavior and acceptance criteria (issue/PR/user ask).
- Risk context (auth, payments, data writes, migrations, public APIs).
- Existing tests and validation signals.

## Severity model (required)

Use this severity model consistently:

- **P0 (critical):** Security vulnerability, data loss risk, broken behavior.
- **P1 (high):** Likely bug, major performance issue, significant design flaw.
- **P2 (medium):** Maintainability/code smell worth fixing in this cycle.
- **P3 (low):** Minor clarity/readability suggestion.

## Review workflow (required order)

1. **Scope the change**
   - Identify files changed and the functional area affected.
   - Understand the intent from PR description, issue text, or commit summary.
2. **Run architecture impact screen**
   - Evaluate API contracts, data model/schema changes, dependency boundaries,
     auth boundaries, observability, and rollback safety.
   - If impact is non-trivial, load `references/architecture-impact-checklist.md`.
3. **Run high-level checks**
   - Validate architecture fit, data flow, and API contract impact.
   - Check whether test strategy matches risk level.
4. **Run detailed checks**
   - Correctness and edge cases
   - Security and input validation
   - Performance hotspots and resource usage
   - Error handling and observability
   - Readability and maintainability
5. **Write findings with evidence**
   - Include file path and line (or nearest anchor) whenever possible.
   - Explain impact and provide a concrete fix suggestion.
6. **Conclude with a decision**
   - `APPROVE`, `COMMENT`, or `REQUEST_CHANGES`.
   - Include issue counts by severity.
7. **If Mode B, run iterative remediation loop**
   - Log issue list before editing.
   - Fix by severity order: P0 → P1 → P2 → P3.
   - Re-run review checks after each fix wave.
   - Maintain a regression ledger so new fixes do not reintroduce prior issues.
   - If the same fixes toggle more than 3 times, stop and ask for user guidance.
8. **Final quality gate**
   - Load `references/review-quality-checklist.md` and verify decision consistency.

## On-demand resources

Use progressive disclosure. Load only what is needed:

- `references/architecture-impact-checklist.md`
  - Load when changes touch contracts, schemas, boundaries, or deployment safety.
- `references/review-quality-checklist.md`
  - Load before finalizing the review decision.
- `scripts/collect_review_context.py`
  - Optional helper for deterministic diff scope summary.
  - Run only when git context is ambiguous or large.
- `scripts/test_collect_review_context.py`
  - Regression tests for the review-context helper.
  - Run after editing `scripts/collect_review_context.py`.
- `references/evaluation-playbook.md`
  - Load when improving this skill itself (trigger quality and output quality evals).

## Review output format

Use this response structure:

1. `Summary`
   - Scope reviewed and overall decision.
2. `Findings`
   - Group by severity in order: P0, P1, P2, P3.
   - Each finding includes: location, issue, impact, suggested fix.
3. `Architecture impact`
   - State impacted boundaries and risk level (`low`, `medium`, `high`).
   - If no material impact, explicitly say so.
4. `Strengths`
   - Mention at least one positive observation when present.
5. `Next steps`
   - State exactly what should happen next (merge, fix blockers, follow-up task).

## Completion conditions

This skill is complete only when:

- A decision is provided (`APPROVE`, `COMMENT`, or `REQUEST_CHANGES`).
- Findings are prioritized by severity.
- Every blocking issue (P0/P1) includes a specific remediation path.
- Architecture impact is explicitly covered.
- If no issues are found, the review explicitly states what was checked.
- In Mode B, a final zero-blocker pass is completed after fixes.

## Guardrails

- Prioritize correctness and security over stylistic preferences.
- Do not block on formatting nits unless they hide functional risk.
- Avoid vague statements; every issue must be actionable.
- Keep recommendations incremental and safe by default.

## Gotchas

- Do not skip architecture impact review for schema/API/auth changes.
- Do not provide a decision without evidence-backed findings.
- Do not start fixing before logging issues first in Mode B.
- Do not collapse multiple blockers into one generic comment.
