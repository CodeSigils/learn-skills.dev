name: xcode-disk-cleanup
description: >-
  Audit and safely clean Xcode-related developer storage on macOS. Use whenever a
  developer mentions low disk space, Xcode storage, DerivedData, simulator devices
  or runtimes, stale beta platforms in Xcode Settings, DeviceSupport, archives,
  dSYMs, CocoaPods caches, simulator dyld caches, project .build
  folders, downloaded Xcode DMGs/XIPs, duplicate Xcode installers, or old Xcode
  applications. Also use this skill proactively when you hit low storage during
  other work, such as a build, download, or install failing with an
  out-of-disk-space error. Always measure first, report recoverable GiB with
  evidence, and obtain explicit itemized approval before any mutation.

# Xcode Disk Cleanup

## Safety contract

- Treat every cleanup request as permission to audit, not permission to delete.
- Never mutate storage before presenting exact candidate IDs, paths or simulator
  identifiers, measured sizes, risks, and regeneration costs.
- Ask the user to approve specific IDs. Broad replies such as “clean Xcode” or
  “delete everything” are not itemized approval.
- Default ordinary files and directories to Trash. Explain that space is not
  reclaimed until Trash is emptied, and request separate approval before doing so.
- Revalidate identity and running-process usage immediately before mutation.
- Never use wildcards, unbounded `rm -rf`, `sudo`, SIP changes, or manual deletion
  inside system-managed CoreSimulator and MobileAsset directories.
- Preserve archives and dSYMs unless the user proves the exact distributed build
  is backed up elsewhere and separately approves deletion.
- Never delete `Package.resolved`, signing assets, credentials, custom DocSets, the
  active Xcode, a running simulator, or an Xcode that uniquely provides a required
  SDK/toolchain.
- Report summed candidate sizes separately from actual APFS space recovered.

Read `references/safety-model.md` before applying cleanup.

## Workflow

### 1. Preflight

1. Confirm the host is macOS and the bundled script is available.
2. Check for active Xcode, Simulator, `xcodebuild`, Swift build, test, archive, and
   package-resolution processes.
3. If builds are active, audit may continue, but defer all cleanup.
4. Determine optional source roots for project-local `.build` and `.derived-data`
   scanning. Do not crawl the whole home directory.

### 2. Run the read-only audit

```bash
python3 "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/xcode_disk_cleanup.py" audit \
  --output-dir .xcode-disk-cleanup-audit \
  [--scan-root /path/to/projects]
```

Read both generated files:

- `.xcode-disk-cleanup-audit/report.md`
- `.xcode-disk-cleanup-audit/audit.json`

The script audits DerivedData, documentation caches, CocoaPods caches, simulator
devices and runtimes (including stale superseded beta runtimes), orphan runtime
volumes, simulator dyld caches, Xcode-managed components, Xcode installers,
installed Xcodes, archives (including never-distributed orphans), DeviceSupport
for every platform, diagnostic logs, XCTest device clones, legacy DocSets, and
explicitly requested project roots.

Shared compiler caches (`ModuleCache.noindex`, precompiled SDK modules) and the
global SwiftPM download cache are deliberately out of scope: they are always in
use on an active development machine, and clearing them trades real build-time
pain for little lasting space. Do not propose them.

### 3. Validate and enrich findings

Use the category router:

| Finding | Reference |
|---|---|
| DerivedData, module caches, project `.build`, CocoaPods | `references/generated-data.md` |
| Simulator devices, runtimes, dyld caches, XCTest clones | `references/simulators.md` |
| Archives, dSYMs, DeviceSupport, logs, DocSets | `references/release-artifacts.md` |
| Xcode DMGs/XIPs and installed Xcodes | `references/xcode-installations.md` |
| Confirmation and deletion behavior | `references/safety-model.md` |

Do not mechanically accept a scanner classification. Verify uncertain ownership,
custom paths, backups, and toolchain requirements.

### 4. Present the proposal

Sort by recoverable GiB and show:

1. Candidate ID
2. Category and exact path/identifier
3. Recoverable GiB
4. Risk: regenerable, destructive, or preserve
5. Evidence — a short "why this is stale" phrase (age in days, superseded-by,
   missing workspace), not just a classification label
6. What must be rebuilt, redownloaded, or permanently lost
7. Proposed action

Keep the proposal scannable:

- Render folder candidates as clickable `file://` links so the user can inspect
  them before approving.
- Hide individual items below roughly 0.5 GiB; the full itemized list stays in
  `report.md` for reference. Do not pad the proposal with a "small items" bucket —
  it adds questions, not signal.
- Group unavailable simulators into a table per runtime.
- Give every category its own subheading with its total size, even small ones
  like documentation caches or orphan archives. A category summarized in a
  trailing paragraph under another category's table gets overlooked, and
  overlooked items cannot be meaningfully approved.

Include:

- Total candidate GiB by risk
- Current free disk space
- A warning that APFS cloning and snapshots make candidate sizes non-additive
- A direct request for approval of exact IDs

### 5. Apply only approved IDs

Invoke apply only after the user explicitly approves the exact IDs shown in the
current audit:

```bash
python3 "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/xcode_disk_cleanup.py" apply \
  --audit-file .xcode-disk-cleanup-audit/audit.json \
  --ids "<approved-id-1>" "<approved-id-2>" \
  --confirm I_APPROVED_THE_SELECTED_ITEMS \
  --output .xcode-disk-cleanup-audit/cleanup-result.json
```

Simulator device and runtime deletions are irreversible and require a second
approval plus:

```text
--confirm-irreversible I_APPROVED_IRREVERSIBLE_SIMULATOR_DELETION
```

A stale runtime is only proposed when `simctl` reports it deletable, no installed
Xcode SDK resolves to its build, and a newer runtime supersedes it on the same
platform. This is the pattern behind leftover beta platforms in Xcode Settings →
Components after installing a newer Xcode beta.

Do not pass either confirmation phrase unless the corresponding user approval is
present in the conversation.

### 6. Verify

1. Re-run the audit.
2. Compare `df` free space before and after.
3. Distinguish “moved to Trash” from immediately reclaimed space.
4. Confirm protected and unapproved candidates remain.
5. Report successes, failures, and deferred items.

## Xcode installer and application rules

- Search `.xip`, `.dmg`, and `.zip` installers through Spotlight and common
  download folders.
- Suggest an installer only when its parsed version matches an installed Xcode;
  otherwise report it as uncertain.
- An older Xcode may only be suggested, never automatically selected, when it is
  not active/running and a newer same-channel installation exists.
- Spotlight `kMDItemLastUsedDate` reflects LaunchServices opens, not command-line
  use. Combine it with `xcode-select`, `DEVELOPER_DIR`, running processes,
  `.xcode-version`, CI scripts, and unique SDK/toolchain evidence.
- Never infer that a stable Xcode supersedes a beta, or vice versa.

## Output quality checklist

- [ ] Audit completed without mutation
- [ ] Every item has an exact size and stable ID
- [ ] Candidate and actual recovered space are separate
- [ ] Archives/dSYMs are preserve-by-default
- [ ] Active processes and selected Xcode are protected
- [ ] User approved exact IDs
- [ ] Irreversible operations received separate approval
- [ ] Post-cleanup audit confirms only approved items changed
