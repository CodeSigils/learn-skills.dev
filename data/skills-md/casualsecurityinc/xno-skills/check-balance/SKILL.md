# Check XNO Balance (RPC)

When a user asks "did you receive it?" / "check the balance", you need an on-chain data source. This skill queries a **Nano node RPC** (user-provided) for `balance` and `pending` (both in raw).

## Important nuance: pending vs received

Nano can show funds as **pending** until the receiving wallet publishes the receive/open block. Many wallet apps do this automatically; raw keys alone do not.

**If you see pending funds, you must call `wallet_receive` to pocket them.**

## Well-known Public RPC Nodes

If the user doesn't have an RPC URL, suggest these public nodes:
- `https://rpc.nano.org` (Nano Foundation)
- `https://app.natrium.io/api/rpc` (Natrium)
- `https://nanonode.cc/api` (NanoNode.cc)
- `https://node.somenano.site/api` (SomeNano)

## CLI usage (`xno-skills`)

Set an RPC URL (recommended):

```bash
export NANO_RPC_URL="https://rpc.nano.org"
```

Then:

```bash
npx -y xno-skills rpc account-balance <address> --json --xno
```

Or pass the URL explicitly:

```bash
npx -y xno-skills rpc account-balance <address> --url "https://rpc.nano.org" --json --xno
```

If the user has a mnemonic and isn't sure whether it's **bip39** or **legacy** (common with 24-word phrases), prefer:

```bash
# Don't paste mnemonics into chat; run locally and use stdin
npx -y xno-skills wallet probe-mnemonic --stdin --url "https://rpc.nano.org" --json
```

## MCP usage (`xno-mcp`)

If the agent has access to the `xno-mcp` tools:

**First, set defaults (recommended):**
```
config_set: { "rpcUrl": "https://rpc.nano.org" }
```

**Then check balance:**
- `rpc_account_balance` with `{ "address": "...", "includeXno": true }`
- `wallet_balance` with `{ "name": "A", "index": 0 }`
- `wallet_probe_balances` with `{ "name": "A", "count": 5 }` - Also shows which accounts are opened

**If you see pending funds, receive them:**
- `wallet_receive` with `{ "name": "A", "index": 0 }`

## Fallback (no RPC available)

If the user can't provide an RPC URL (or the environment has no network access), ask them to check the address in a block explorer or in their wallet app and report back:

- confirmed on-chain balance
- pending/receivable amount (if shown)
