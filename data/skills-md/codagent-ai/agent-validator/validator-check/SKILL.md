# /validator-check
Run validator checks only — no AI reviews.

## Invocation Policy

Use this skill only when the user explicitly asks for validator checks only, checks without reviews, static checks, or validation without AI review.

Do not choose this skill for generic "run the validator", "run the gauntlet", "run validation", or final verification requests; use `/validator-run` for those.

## Procedure

### Step 1 - Clean Logs

Run `agent-validate clean` to archive any previous log files.

### Step 2 - Run Checks

Run `agent-validate check` using `Bash` with `timeout: 300000`. **ALWAYS wait for and read the full command output** before proceeding. **Verify you can see a `Status:` line in the output before continuing.**

### Step 3 - Check Status

**NEVER assume success** — you must see an explicit `Status:` line before continuing. Check it and route accordingly:
- `Status: Passed` → Go to Step 7.
- `Status: Passed with warnings` → Go to Step 7.
- `Status: Failed` → Continue to Step 4. **You MUST continue — do not stop here.**
- `Status: Retry limit exceeded` → Run `agent-validate clean` to archive logs. Go to Step 7.
- No status line visible → **Known issue:** Bun can drop all stdout/stderr. Read the console log file to get the status: find the latest `console.*.log` in the validator log directory (e.g., `validator_logs/console.1.log`) and look for the `Status:` line there. If no console log is found there, also check `validator_logs/previous/` for logs from the most recent archived run. If no console log exists in either location, the command may have timed out or failed to run — re-run with a longer timeout or investigate the error. Do NOT proceed as if it passed.

### Step 4 - Extract Failures

Required when status is Failed:
- Infer the log directory from the file paths in the console output (e.g., if output references `validator_logs/check_._lint.1.log`, the log directory is `validator_logs/`)
- **Extract log failures** using the first available strategy:
  a. **Task tool** (Claude Code): `Task` with `subagent_type="general-purpose"`, `model="haiku"`, `prompt=` the Extract Prompt (from the Appendix below) + `"\n\nLog directory: <inferred path>"`. **Task calls MUST be synchronous** — NEVER use `run_in_background: true`.
  b. **Subagent delegation**: If your environment supports delegating work to a subagent but not the Task tool, delegate the Extract Prompt instructions with the log directory to a subagent for processing.
  c. **Inline fallback**: If no subagent capability is available, follow the Extract Prompt instructions yourself to read the log files and produce the compact failure summary.

### Step 5 - Fix

Fix all failed checks:
- CHECK failures with Fix Skill: invoke the named skill
- CHECK failures with Fix Instructions: follow the instructions

### Step 6 - Re-run Verification

**NEVER skip this step** — if the run failed, you MUST fix and re-run. Run `agent-validate check` again with `Bash` and `timeout: 300000`. Do NOT run `agent-validate clean` between retries. The tool detects existing logs and automatically switches to verification mode. **Go back to Step 3** to check the status line and repeat.

### Step 7 - Summarize Session

Provide a summary of the session:
- Final Status: (Passed / Passed with warnings / Retry limit exceeded)
- Checks Fixed: (list key fixes)
- Outstanding Failures: (if retry limit exceeded, list unverified fixes and remaining issues)

## Appendix: Subagent Prompts

### Extract Prompt

You are an EXTRACT subagent. Your job is to read validator check log files and return a compact error summary.

#### Input

You receive a log directory path as your only input.

#### Process

1. List files directly under the log directory
2. Find the highest-numbered `console.N.log` file (e.g., `console.3.log` > `console.2.log`)
3. Read it and find all lines containing `[FAIL]`
4. For each `[FAIL]` line, extract the referenced `.log` file path
5. Read each referenced log file and extract error output. Look for `--- Fix Instructions ---` sections and `--- Fix Skill: <name> ---` sections. Include their full content.

#### Output Format

Return a plain-text summary using EXACTLY this format:

```text
CHECKS:
[fail] <gate_label>
<concise error description>
Fix Instructions: <extracted text if present, otherwise omit this line>
Fix Skill: <skill name if present, otherwise omit this line>
```

#### Example

##### Example Input

Log directory: `validator_logs/`

The directory contains:
- `console.2.log`
- `check_src_lint.2.log`

**console.2.log** contains:
```text
[START] check:src:lint
[FAIL]  check:src:lint (1.23s) - Exited with code 1
      Log: validator_logs/check_src_lint.2.log
```

**check_src_lint.2.log** contains:
```text
[2026-02-15T10:23:45.123Z] Starting check: lint
Executing command: bun run lint
Working directory: /Users/user/project/src

src/helpers.ts:3:5 - error: Unexpected var, use let or const instead

Command failed: bun run lint
Result: fail - Exited with code 1

--- Fix Instructions ---
Replace all `var` declarations with `const` or `let`.
```

##### Example Output

```text
CHECKS:
[fail] check:src:lint
src/helpers.ts:3:5 - error: Unexpected var, use let or const instead
Fix Instructions: Replace all `var` declarations with `const` or `let`.
```

#### Rules

- Do NOT summarize or editorialize — copy error details verbatim where possible
- Do NOT skip any `[FAIL]` entries
- Keep the output compact — one entry per check failure
- Include `Fix Instructions` / `Fix Skill` lines only when present
