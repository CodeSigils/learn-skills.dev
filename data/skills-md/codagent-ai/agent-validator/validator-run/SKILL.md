# /validator-run
Execute the autonomous verification suite.

## Invocation Policy

Use this skill only for explicit validation requests, such as "run the validator", "run the gauntlet", "run validation", "validate this", or "validate before commit/push/PR".

Do not choose this skill merely because a coding task was completed, because the user asked for a generic review, or because the user asked for checks only.

## Procedure

### Step 1 - Run Agent Validator

If the caller requests a specific review to be enabled, append `--enable-review <name>` to the run command for each requested review.

Run `agent-validate run` using `Bash` with `timeout: 300000`. **ALWAYS wait for and read the full command output** before proceeding — the command typically takes 1-2 minutes. **Verify you can see a `Status:` line in the output before continuing.**

### Step 2 - Check Status

**NEVER assume success** — you must see an explicit `Status:` line before continuing. Check it and route accordingly:
- `Status: Passed` → Go to Step 8.
- `Status: Passed with warnings` → Go to Step 8.
- `Status: Failed` → Continue to Step 3. **You MUST continue — do not stop here.**
- `Status: Retry limit exceeded` → Go to Step 8.
- No status line visible → **Known issue:** Bun can drop all stdout/stderr when LLM review subprocesses run. Read the console log file to get the status: find the latest `console.*.log` in the validator log directory (e.g., `validator_logs/console.1.log`) and look for the `Status:` line there. If no console log is found there, also check `validator_logs/previous/` for logs from the most recent archived run. If no console log exists in either location, the command may have timed out or failed to run — re-run with a longer timeout or investigate the error. Do NOT proceed as if it passed.

### Step 3 - Extract Failures

Required when status is Failed:
- Infer the log directory from the file paths in the console output (e.g., if output references `validator_logs/check_._lint.1.log`, the log directory is `validator_logs/`)
- **Extract log failures** using the first available strategy:
  a. **Task tool** (Claude Code): `Task` with `subagent_type="general-purpose"`, `model="haiku"`, `prompt=` the Extract Prompt (from the Appendix below) + `"\n\nLog directory: <inferred path>"`. **Task calls MUST be synchronous** — NEVER use `run_in_background: true`.
  b. **Subagent delegation**: If your environment supports delegating work to a subagent but not the Task tool, delegate the Extract Prompt instructions with the log directory to a subagent for processing.
  c. **Inline fallback**: If no subagent capability is available, follow the Extract Prompt instructions yourself to read the log files and produce the compact failure summary.

### Step 4 - Report Failures

Print the compact failure summary returned from Step 3.

### Step 5 - Fix

Fix issues reasonably supported by the feedback or likely intended by the human. When skipping an issue, briefly state what was skipped and why.

**Valid reasons to skip:**
- Purely stylistic or subjective preference
- The human would not want it changed

**You MUST NOT skip for these reasons:**
- "Issue is pre-existing" — you MUST fix it unless you have another valid reason
- "Issue is out of scope" — you MUST address valid feedback even if it requires refactoring or non-trivial changes

Apply this guidance to each failure and fix accordingly:
- CHECK failures with Fix Skill: invoke the named skill
- CHECK failures with Fix Instructions: follow the instructions
- REVIEW violations: fix or skip per the guidance above

### Step 6 - Update Review Decisions

For REVIEW violations you addressed:
- **Update review decisions** using the first available strategy (same as Step 3):
  a. **Task tool** (Claude Code): `Task` with `subagent_type="general-purpose"`, `model="haiku"`, `prompt=` the Update Prompt (from the Appendix below) + log directory + decisions list. **Task calls MUST be synchronous** — NEVER use `run_in_background: true`.
  b. **Subagent delegation**: Delegate the Update Prompt instructions with the log directory and decisions to a subagent.
  c. **Inline fallback**: Follow the Update Prompt instructions yourself to update the review JSON files.

### Step 7 - Re-run Verification

**NEVER skip this step** — if the run failed, you MUST fix and re-run. Run the same command from Step 1 (including any `--enable-review` flags) again with `Bash` and `timeout: 300000`. The tool detects existing logs and automatically switches to verification mode. **Go back to Step 2** to check the status line and repeat.

### Step 8 - Summarize Session

Provide a summary of the session:
- Final Status: (Passed / Passed with warnings / Retry limit exceeded)
- Issues Fixed: (list key fixes)
- Issues Skipped: (list skipped items and reasons)
- Outstanding Failures: (if retry limit exceeded, list unverified fixes and remaining issues)

## Appendix: Subagent Prompts

### Extract Prompt

You are an EXTRACT subagent. Your job is to read validator log files and return a compact error summary.

#### Input

You receive a log directory path as your only input.

#### Process

1. List files directly under the log directory
2. Find the highest-numbered `console.N.log` file (e.g., `console.3.log` > `console.2.log`)
3. Read it and find all lines containing `[FAIL]`
4. For each `[FAIL]` line, extract the referenced file path
5. Read each referenced file:
   - **`.log` files** (check gates): Extract error output. Look for `--- Fix Instructions ---` sections and `--- Fix Skill: <name> ---` sections. Include their full content.
   - **`.json` files** (review gates): Parse the JSON. Find violations where `status` is `"new"`. For each, extract: `file`, `line`, `issue`, `priority`, `fix`.

#### Output Format

Return a plain-text summary using EXACTLY this format:

For check failures:
```text
CHECKS:
[fail] <gate_label>
<concise error description>
Fix Instructions: <extracted text if present, otherwise omit this line>
Fix Skill: <skill name if present, otherwise omit this line>
```

For review failures:
```text
REVIEWS:
[<priority>] <gate_label>
<file>:<line> - <issue summary>
Fix: <fix suggestion>
```

If there are no failures of a type, omit that section entirely.

#### Example

##### Example Input

Log directory: `validator_logs/`

The directory contains:
- `console.2.log`
- `check_src_lint.2.log`
- `review_src_code-quality_claude@1.2.json`

**console.2.log** contains:
```text
[START] check:src:lint
[FAIL]  check:src:lint (1.23s) - Exited with code 1
      Log: validator_logs/check_src_lint.2.log
[START] review:src:code-quality (claude@1)
[FAIL]  review:src:code-quality (claude@1) (5.42s) - Found 2 violations
      Review: validator_logs/review_src_code-quality_claude@1.2.json
```

**check_src_lint.2.log** contains:
```text
[2026-02-15T10:23:45.123Z] Starting check: lint
Executing command: bun run lint
Working directory: /Users/user/project/src

src/helpers.ts:3:5 - error: Unexpected var, use let or const instead

Command failed: bun run lint
Result: fail - Exited with code 1

--- Fix Instructions ---
Replace all `var` declarations with `const` or `let`.
```

**review_src_code-quality_claude@1.2.json** contains:
```json
{
  "adapter": "claude",
  "status": "fail",
  "violations": [
    {
      "file": "src/main.ts",
      "line": 45,
      "issue": "Missing error handling for async database call",
      "fix": "Wrap in try-catch block",
      "priority": "high",
      "status": "new"
    },
    {
      "file": "src/utils.ts",
      "line": 10,
      "issue": "Function exceeds 50 lines",
      "fix": "Extract helper methods",
      "priority": "medium",
      "status": "fixed"
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Example Output

```text
CHECKS:
[fail] check:src:lint
src/helpers.ts:3:5 - error: Unexpected var, use let or const instead
Fix Instructions: Replace all `var` declarations with `const` or `let`.

REVIEWS:
[high] review:src:code-quality (claude@1)
src/main.ts:45 - Missing error handling for async database call
Fix: Wrap in try-catch block
```

Note: The `src/utils.ts:10` violation was omitted because its status is `"fixed"`, not `"new"`.

#### Rules

- Do NOT summarize or editorialize — copy error details verbatim where possible
- Do NOT skip any `[FAIL]` entries
- Keep the output compact — one entry per check failure, one entry per review violation (3 lines each)
- For review violations, only include those with `status: "new"` — skip `"fixed"` and `"skipped"`

### Update Prompt

You are an UPDATE subagent. Your job is to update review JSON files with fix/skip decisions.

#### Input

You receive:
1. A log directory path
2. A list of decisions, each with: `file`, `line`, `issue_prefix`, `status` ("fixed" or "skipped"), and `result` (brief description)

#### Process

For each decision:
1. Find the matching `.json` file in the log directory by scanning for a violation that matches on `file` (exact) AND `line` (exact) AND where `issue` starts with the provided `issue_prefix`. If multiple violations match, use the first unprocessed one (status still `"new"`)
2. Read the JSON file
3. Find the matching violation in the `violations` array
4. Set `"status"` to the provided status value
5. Set `"result"` to the provided result string
6. Write the updated JSON back to the same file path

#### Rules

- Do NOT modify any fields other than `status` and `result`
- Do NOT modify violations that don't match the provided decisions
- Preserve all other JSON structure and key ordering
- If a violation cannot be found, report it in your response but continue with other decisions
- Write the JSON with 2-space indentation

#### Example

##### Example Input

Log directory: `validator_logs/`

Decisions:
- file: `src/main.ts`, line: 45, issue_prefix: `Missing error handling`, status: `fixed`, result: `Added try-catch around database call`
- file: `src/utils.ts`, line: 10, issue_prefix: `Function exceeds`, status: `skipped`, result: `Stylistic preference, function is readable as-is`

The log directory contains `review_src_code-quality_claude@1.2.json`:
```json
{
  "adapter": "claude",
  "status": "fail",
  "violations": [
    {
      "file": "src/main.ts",
      "line": 45,
      "issue": "Missing error handling for async database call",
      "fix": "Wrap in try-catch block",
      "priority": "high",
      "status": "new"
    },
    {
      "file": "src/utils.ts",
      "line": 10,
      "issue": "Function exceeds 50 lines",
      "fix": "Extract helper methods",
      "priority": "medium",
      "status": "new"
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Example Output (what you write to the JSON file)

After updating, `review_src_code-quality_claude@1.2.json` becomes:
```json
{
  "adapter": "claude",
  "status": "fail",
  "violations": [
    {
      "file": "src/main.ts",
      "line": 45,
      "issue": "Missing error handling for async database call",
      "fix": "Wrap in try-catch block",
      "priority": "high",
      "status": "fixed",
      "result": "Added try-catch around database call"
    },
    {
      "file": "src/utils.ts",
      "line": 10,
      "issue": "Function exceeds 50 lines",
      "fix": "Extract helper methods",
      "priority": "medium",
      "status": "skipped",
      "result": "Stylistic preference, function is readable as-is"
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Example Response

```text
Updated 2 violations:
- src/main.ts:45 — set to fixed
- src/utils.ts:10 — set to skipped
```

#### Output

Return a brief confirmation listing each decision applied:
```text
Updated <N> violations:
- <file>:<line> — set to <status>
```

If any decisions could not be matched, add:
```text
Unmatched decisions:
- <file>:<line> — <issue_prefix> (not found in any JSON file)
```
