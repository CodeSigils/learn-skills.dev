# Video Subtitle Extractor

## When to use this skill
Use this skill when the user provides a link to a video platform (like YouTube, Bilibili) and asks you to summarize, analyze, or explain the video's content.

## Setup and Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure the dependencies are installed. You can install them by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*Note: Make sure your environment has `yt-dlp` working correctly.*

## How to use this skill
1. Run the provided Python script located at `scripts/extract_subtitles.py` from this skill directory.
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/extract_subtitles.py "<VIDEO_URL>"
   ```
2. The script will automatically:
   - **Detect available subtitle languages** and pick the best one (zh-Hans > zh > en).
   - **Try direct download first**, then automatically retry with browser cookies (Chrome → Firefox → Edge → Safari) if the platform requires authentication (e.g., YouTube's "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot").
   - **Clean all HTML/XML tags** from the subtitle text.
   - **Deduplicate** repeated lines from auto-generated subtitles.
3. If successful, the script will output `SUCCESS` and print the `FILE_PATH` to the generated text file containing the subtitles.
4. Use the `view_file` tool to read the contents of the generated file.
5. Using the content from the file, answer the user's original prompt (e.g., summarize the video).
6. If the script fails or outputs that no subtitles are available, inform the user that you are unable to extract the subtitles and cannot analyze the video's content directly using this method. Suggest alternative ways if possible.

## Examples
User says: "Summarize this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1GLT9_tag0"
You run:
```bash
python3 scripts/extract_subtitles.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1GLT9_tag0"
```
You receive `FILE_PATH: /tmp/yt_sub_...txt`.
You use `view_file` on that path.
You reply to the user with the summary.
