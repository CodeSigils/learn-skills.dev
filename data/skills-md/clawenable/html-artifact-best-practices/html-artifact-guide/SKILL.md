description: Produces, reviews, and improves standalone single-file HTML artifacts using vanilla HTML, inline CSS, and vanilla JS — no frameworks or CDN. Use this skill when the user asks to "create a comparison matrix", "build an interactive dashboard", "make a timeline roadmap", "generate an HTML artifact", "review this HTML", "create a review surface", "make a visual explainer", or "create an interactive checklist". Do not use for simple documentation, knowledge base articles, meeting minutes, or any content where Markdown suffices.

# HTML Artifact Best Practices

Produce readable, interactive, shareable, and reviewable single-file HTML artifacts. Avoid treating HTML as a visual wrapper for Markdown or as a substitute for proper frontend engineering.

## Purpose

This skill covers four capabilities:

1. **Judge** — Decide whether HTML is appropriate, or whether Markdown suffices.
2. **Create** — Generate standalone single-file HTML artifacts using inline CSS and vanilla JS.
3. **Review** — Audit existing HTML artifacts for quality, accessibility, and anti-patterns.
4. **Improve** — Refine information architecture, interaction quality, and remove decorative waste.

This skill does NOT use React, Vue, Tailwind, Vite, shadcn/ui, or any framework. If the task requires complex multi-component UIs with state management, use the `web-artifacts-builder` skill instead. These skills are complementary, not interchangeable.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Multi-option comparison with filtering, collapsing, or side-by-side layout
- Interactive reports, dashboards, or visual explanations
- Decision support pages with risk matrices or priority sorting
- Roadmap or timeline views for team review
- Research synthesis requiring non-linear navigation
- Review surfaces for multi-round agent collaboration outputs
- Any output where the user needs to scan, compare, filter, or interact

Do NOT use this skill when:
- Short explanations, notes, or documentation
- Long-term knowledge base articles
- Content needing frequent human editing
- Content primarily consumed by other agents or tools
- Simple tables and lists that Markdown handles well
- Meeting minutes without visual complexity

## Decision Rule

Before generating HTML, apply this decision flow:

1. Does the task involve human review, comparison, interaction, or sharing?
   - No → Use Markdown. Stop here.
   - Yes → Continue.
2. Is Markdown sufficient for the user's goal?
   - Yes → Use Markdown. Explain why.
   - No → Use HTML artifact. Continue to creation workflow.

Boundary signals — judge before acting:
- "Make this into a webpage" → Ask: does HTML add value beyond visual decoration?
- "HTML version of this document" → Ask: is Markdown insufficient?
- "Make a dashboard" → Ask: are there real metrics and relationships to display?

## Output Contract

Every HTML artifact must satisfy these requirements:

- **Single file** — All HTML, CSS, and JS in one `.html` file
- **Valid structure** — `<!doctype html>`, `<meta charset="utf-8">`, viewport meta tag
- **Semantic HTML** — Use `<table>` for tabular data, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<details>` for document structure. Never use `<div>` + CSS to simulate tables.
- **Inline CSS** — All styles in a single `<style>` block, no external stylesheets
- **Vanilla JS** — All scripts in a single `<script>` block, no frameworks or libraries
- **No CDN** — No external stylesheets, scripts, fonts, or images
- **Responsive** — Readable on mobile (375px width) without horizontal scrolling
- **Copyable** — Key content selectable and copyable as plain text. No `user-select: none` on content areas.
- **Labeled controls** — Use native `<button>` for interactive elements (inherently keyboard-focusable). Add `:focus-visible` outline styles.
- **Clear hierarchy** — Title, summary, body, and action items or conclusions visible
- **Structured data** — Important data not locked into visual-only presentation
- **AI disclaimer** — Include "AI-generated. Verify critical decisions independently."
- **No generation metadata** — Do not display model names, token counts, or process details
- **Print-ready** — Include `@media print` rules: hide interactive controls, expand `<details>`, set `overflow: visible`, add `break-inside: avoid` on key sections

## Anti-Patterns

These are the most common mistakes. Check against them before presenting any artifact:

1. **Markdown-in-a-card** — Wrapping plain text in cards, gradients, and backgrounds without adding information density or interaction
2. **Framework default** — Using React, Vue, Tailwind, or any framework when vanilla HTML suffices
3. **Forced HTML** — Generating HTML for simple text that Markdown handles better
4. **AI slop aesthetics** — Purple gradients, excessive rounded corners, centered card layouts, Inter font
5. **Empty dashboard** — Building a dashboard layout without real metric relationships
6. **False certainty** — Using visual weight to create an impression of certainty that the content does not support
7. **Network dependency** — Requiring internet access to render or function
8. **Mobile-hostile** — Wide tables, fixed-width layouts, or tiny text on mobile
9. **Dead interactions** — Buttons, filters, or tabs that do not add actual value
10. **Data lock-in** — Presenting data only visually with no way to copy, select, or extract it

## Creation Workflow

1. **Understand the goal** — What is the user trying to accomplish? Who will read or use this artifact?
2. **Decide: HTML or Markdown?** — Apply the Decision Rule. If Markdown suffices, say so and use Markdown.
3. **Choose a pattern** — Read `references/artifact-patterns.md` and select the pattern that fits. If no pattern fits, create a minimal custom structure.
4. **Organize content** — Separate information into: title/summary, structured body, interaction points, conclusions or action items.
5. **Generate HTML** — Follow the Output Contract. Use `assets/standalone-template.html` as the structural baseline if helpful.
6. **Self-check** — Before presenting, verify every Output Contract requirement is met (all 14 items). Check: does every section serve the user's goal? Are there any anti-patterns? Is the content copyable?

## Review Workflow

1. **Content fidelity** — Does the artifact faithfully represent the source information?
2. **Information architecture** — Is the hierarchy clear? Can a reader scan and find what they need?
3. **Interaction quality** — Does every interactive element serve a purpose?
4. **Anti-pattern scan** — Check against all 10 anti-patterns listed above.
5. **Mobile readiness** — Test mentally at 375px width.
6. **Dependency check** — Any external resources? If so, are they justified?
7. **Data accessibility** — Can key data be copied, selected, or exported?

For a comprehensive checklist, read `references/review-checklist.md`.
