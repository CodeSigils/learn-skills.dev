# Agently Runtime

Use this Skill after the request/workflow owner is known. Start with `agently`
when the layer is still undecided, and use `agently-triggerflow` for visible
branching, concurrency, pause/resume, retry, or multi-stage orchestration.

## Read Only What the Task Needs

- Actions, Search/Browse, MCP, approval, Action artifacts, or AgentTask evidence:
  read `references/actions-runtime.md`.
- Action versus ExecutionResource, managed runtimes, sandbox/process/browser/
  SQLite resources: read `references/actions-execution-resource.md`.
- RuntimeEvent, logs, traces, evaluation, playground, or DevTools: read
  `references/devtools.md`.
- TaskContext, ContextReader, TaskWorkspace, RecordStore, SkillLibrary, or the
  SkillsExecutor compatibility facade: read
  `../agently/references/context-and-skills.md`.

## Owner Boundaries

| Owner | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `ActionRuntime` | Model-callable operations, schema validation, dispatch, policy, and Action results. |
| `ExecutionResource` | Lifecycle of live clients, sandboxes, processes, browsers, database connections, and MCP sessions. |
| `TaskWorkspace` | One task's existing files, generated artifacts, path containment, bounded readback, file identity, and verified terminal promotion. |
| `RecordStore` | Records, links, retrieval, RuntimeEvent persistence, checkpoints, snapshots, leases, and durable artifact refs. |
| `TaskContext` | Sole task-information aggregate; revisioned bindings/direct entries, internal derived `ContextIndex`, and read-handle lifecycle. |
| `ContextReader` | TaskContext-created intent-driven, budgeted progressive-disclosure handle for one consumer and phase. |
| `SkillLibrary` | Installed immutable real-world Skill revisions and resource reads. |
| `AgentExecution` | Task-scoped Skill binding, TaskContext preparation, route selection, execution, and result/stream APIs. |

Do not merge these owners into a generic Workspace or runtime manager. File
space is not record storage; record storage is not model-hot context; a Skill
package is not an executor or permission grant.

## Native Action Rules

- Prefer `@agent.action_func` and `agent.use_actions(...)`; `tool_func`,
  `use_tool`, `use_tools`, and `agently.builtins.tools` are compatibility
  surfaces.
- Mount built-in Search/Browse with
  `agent.use_actions(Search(...))` / `agent.use_actions(Browse(...))`; do not
  invent `enable_search(...)`.
- Treat multi-Action package registration as atomic. A partial Search or MCP
  registration failure must remove batch-created Actions and restore any
  same-id host registration.
- Treat model-planned Action arguments as untrusted. Validate against the
  registered schema, authorization, and policy before dispatch.
- Treat Action output and Action artifacts as evidence only after the host has
  recorded the actual call. Model prose claiming a side effect is not Action
  evidence.
- Keep permission profiles explicit and narrow. Do not expose shell,
  filesystem, MCP, browser, install, or network capabilities merely because an
  AgentTask exists.

## File and Storage Rules

- Select a task file root with `agent.use_task_workspace(path, mode=...)`.
  Enable model-callable file work with
  `agent.enable_task_workspace_file_actions(...)` or
  `agent.enable_coding_agent_actions(...)`.
- `TaskWorkspace` is a file boundary only. Use its read/write/edit/glob/grep/
  patch/export methods for task files and artifacts; do not store arbitrary
  durable records inside it through a hidden database API.
- A required AgentTask terminal deliverable starts as a staged candidate. The
  verifier receives a complete readback; only acceptance permits digest-pinned
  atomic promotion to the target and a complete post-promotion readback.
  Rejection preserves the previous target, and promotion/readback failure
  blocks delivery.
- For TaskWorkspace-bound shell execution, resolve relative `workdir` values
  inside the injected root. Accept `.`/child paths and consume an already
  root-prefixed logical `.agently/files/<execution-id>` locator exactly once;
  reject paths outside the root.
- Select durable records with `agent.use_record_store(...)` or pass a
  `RecordStore` to an explicit TriggerFlow execution. Use it for `put`, `get`,
  `retrieve`, links, RuntimeEvents, snapshots, checkpoints, leases, and durable
  artifact refs.
- Keep process state in memory/logs by default. Enable AgentTask
  `record_store_recovery` only when restart-safe recovery is required.
- Keep ordinary observation in logs/DevTools. Bind RuntimeEvent persistence
  explicitly; a RecordStore does not become an event archive merely because it
  is available.
- Keep large bodies cold behind TaskWorkspace, RecordStore, SkillLibrary, or
  another attached ContextSource. Put only compact handles, descriptors,
  bounded previews, status, and lineage facts in execution state and model-hot
  context. TaskContext's internal ContextIndex narrows reusable candidates;
  ContextReader obtains exact bodies from the source before delivery.

## Real-World Skills

- Treat standard `SKILL.md` packages as guidance plus addressable resources.
  They do not own execution strategy, routing, Action mounting, permissions, or
  side-effect proof.
- Install and inspect immutable revisions through `SkillLibrary` or the thin
  `Agently.skills_executor` management facade. Use registered
  `SkillSourceProvider` implementations for authorized local or Git sources;
  pin a Git `ref` and optional `subpath` rather than inventing a host checkout
  helper.
- Bind optional or required Skills on an `AgentExecution` with
  `execution.use_skills(...)`, `execution.require_skills(...)`, or
  `execution.use_skills_packs(...)`.
- Let `AgentExecution` prepare the shared TaskContext and read it for the
  actual consumer/phase with `async_prepare_task_context()` and
  `async_read_task_context(...)`.
- Provide Actions/MCP/ExecutionResources explicitly. Reading a Skill may inform
  the model that an operation exists; it never creates or authorizes that
  operation.
- When a trusted, exactly bound Skill revision contains an executable script,
  call `agent.bind_skill_script_action(...)` only after
  `execution.async_prepare_task_context()`. Pass the host-issued `binding_id`,
  exact resource path, and `SkillScriptAuthorization`; the binding registers an
  ordinary Action and never makes every script automatically callable. For a
  host-directed run, dispatch `bound_action.action_id` through
  `agent.action.async_execute_action(...)`, then read its published artifact
  path through the same execution's TaskWorkspace.
- `Agently.skills_executor` is a compatibility facade for source-backed or
  local install, configure, inspect, list, resource read, context-pack
  projection, and the TaskDAG Skill resolver. It is not a plugin route,
  planner, strategy registry, React loop, capability manager, or execution
  owner.
- `agent.run_skills_task(...)` remains a thin compatibility adapter to an
  ordinary AgentExecution. New code should create/configure the execution
  directly.
- There is no `SkillsManager`, `skill_activation` Block, Skills route,
  `single_shot`/`staged`/`react` Skills strategy family, or
  `configure_skill_capabilities(...)` auto-mount path in the current
  development-line contract.

## AgentExecution and AgentTask

- Use a fresh `agent.create_execution()` for multi-statement setup. A completed
  execution is an immutable run record; create another execution for another
  run.
- Use `agent.create_task(...)` / `agent.create_task_loop(...)` only when the
  model should own planning, bounded execution, evidence, verification, and
  replan. They return AgentExecution drafts, not public AgentTask handles.
- `strategy("direct")` selects an ordinary model request with the Action loop.
  `strategy("auto")` may select AgentTask when structural task signals exist;
  `flat` and `taskboard` explicitly select the corresponding AgentTask shape.
- Use `AgentExecutionResult.get_data()` for the business value,
  `get_full_data()` for the route/task envelope, `get_text()` for user-facing
  text, and `get_meta()` for process facts.
- Treat `instant` as provisional structured progress and `delta` as printable
  text. Irreversible work must wait for the final parsed result and host
  validation.
- Add non-blocking operator context to a running task with
  `execution.async_add_guidance(...)`. Use TriggerFlow pause/resume when an
  answer is required before work can continue.
- Require actual Action evidence for required side effects. TaskWorkspace
  readback proves a file fact; it does not prove an unrelated Action call.
- When a sufficient completed TaskBoard control result provides a draftable
  artifact manifest without a body, let the dedicated artifact-draft stage
  materialize it with the same bounded canonical Action/readback evidence
  ledger. Framework-owned materialization is not semantic `remaining_work`;
  the resulting candidate still requires terminal verification and promotion.

## TriggerFlow and Recovery

- Use TriggerFlow execution state for per-execution handoff. `flow_data` is
  shared across executions and is not concurrency-safe task memory.
- Bind `snapshot_store`, `runtime_event_store`, and other recovery ports to a
  RecordStore only when the workflow needs those durable capabilities.
- Persist live resource descriptors, never live clients or secrets. Reconstruct
  ExecutionResources through host/plugin resolvers during load.
- Use explicit execution handles for pause/resume, external emit, save/load,
  intervention, inspection, cancellation, or host-controlled close.
- A local RecordStore can prove local restart behavior. Do not describe it as a
  production multi-worker Redis/Postgres/object-storage adapter without a real
  provider and operational evidence.

## Observation and Service Boundaries

- RuntimeEvent and DevTools are observation surfaces. They do not own routing,
  semantic relevance, authorization, verification, or acceptance.
- Keep provider telemetry out of prompt, routing, retry-policy, and quality
  decisions unless the application explicitly owns such a deterministic policy.
- Use `FastAPIHelper` or another host transport to expose a known execution
  contract; do not move workflow lifecycle into transport callbacks.
- Treat high-frequency delta aggregation as an outlet/delivery policy. Flush
  best-effort background outlets at an owning close point.
- Keep `agently-devtools` optional and fail-open. Integrate through public
  observation bridges, not source-repository paths.

## Fail-Closed Checks

- Reject unknown Skill revisions, resource refs, candidate keys, Action ids,
  context block keys, recovery providers, and external-resume identities.
- Keep identity reconstruction host-owned. Offer one short selection key to a
  model, validate it, then rejoin canonical records in host code.
- Do not use keyword/regex matching as the semantic owner for intent, Skill
  relevance, route choice, evidence usefulness, or output quality.
- Do not fake model-owned success with canned outputs, framework-level business
  mappings, deterministic substitutes, or test-only production branches.
