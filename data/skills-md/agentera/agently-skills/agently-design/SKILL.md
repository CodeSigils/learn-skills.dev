description: "Use when the user is designing, reviewing, optimizing, or auditing a non-trivial Agently system across multiple owner layers, including execution-layer selection, ModelRequest prompt/output schema handoffs, point-to-point/fan-out/join topology, instant structured streams, context/evidence/identity boundaries, lifecycle/retry/repair/terminal behavior, concurrency/pressure, observability, or locating where information was lost between requests. The user may describe a multi-model-request application without naming Agently. Use agently-request for one request family and agently-triggerflow for already-decided executable orchestration details."

# Agently Design

Use this skill to design or audit a non-trivial Agently system before choosing
mechanism APIs. It owns cross-layer reasoning and request-chain audit methods;
it does not own executable TriggerFlow definitions and does not own submitted
TaskDAG data.

Treat this page as routing and workflow guidance. When the request needs an
owner matrix, project-layer separation, or the stable-versus-submitted topology
boundary, read `references/system-boundaries.md` rather than answering from this
summary alone.

## Core Workflow

1. Reduce the system into business decisions and completion invariants.
2. Classify each decision as model-owned semantic work, host-owned deterministic
   work, or a hybrid decision before deciding ModelRequest node boundaries.
3. Assign every decision, state, and effect to an existing owner layer.
4. Draw planned request and execution dependencies before choosing APIs.
5. Create a separate ModelRequest only when its decision, input/context boundary,
   output contract, consumer, lifecycle, retry, or parallelism needs independence.
6. Design each ModelRequest prompt/output contract from declared consumer needs.
7. Map output fields to same-response, next-pass, external, user-process,
   point-to-point, fan-out, join, stream, and terminal edges.
8. Design information, evidence, and identity boundaries with fail-closed behavior.
9. Design lifecycle, retry/repair convergence, concurrency, and pressure controls.
10. Design observability and validation before implementation.
11. Route concrete implementation to the owning leaf Skills.
12. For audits, reconstruct actual topology and diff it against the plan.

Keep these two views distinct:

- analysis topology describes logical ModelRequests, information contracts, and
  consumers;
- execution topology describes trusted runtime mechanisms after ownership is
  resolved.

The design view may recommend an owner and produce implementation contracts. It
must not become a second scheduler, flow definition, TaskDAG, retry engine, or
runtime event protocol.

## Route Inside This Skill

- owner layers, project boundaries, stable flow versus submitted DAG, state,
  storage, terminology, or architecture review ->
  `references/system-boundaries.md`
- ModelRequest nodes, prompt/output contracts, schema edges, `instant` fan-out,
  joins, request ledgers, or planned-versus-observed topology ->
  `references/model-request-topology.md`
- ContextPackage, Workspace evidence, trusted selection keys, identity joins,
  refs, citations, snapshots, or evidence fail-closed rules ->
  `references/information-and-evidence-design.md`
- serial/parallel dependencies, concurrency limits, retries, repair, replan,
  approvals, pause/resume, cancellation, close, or terminal status ->
  `references/lifecycle-and-pressure-design.md`
- lineage, RuntimeEvents, request telemetry, topology reconstruction, model
  judges, experiment comparison, or request-chain audit ->
  `references/observability-and-validation.md`

After design ownership is clear, route exact mechanisms as follows:

- single-request provider, prompt, output, response, Session, or retrieval APIs
  -> `agently-request`;
- Action, MCP, ExecutionResource, Workspace, service, or telemetry mechanics ->
  `agently-runtime`;
- model-generated or application-submitted DAG validation and execution ->
  `agently-dynamic-task`;
- developer-owned executable stable workflow topology ->
  `agently-triggerflow`;
- source-framework mapping and migration sequencing -> `agently-migration`.

## Required Design Artifacts

Every non-trivial linear, branching, concurrent, or looped system requires one
planning-topology contract containing all four ledgers:

- owner/invariant ledger;
- planned node ledger;
- planned edge ledger;
- production-necessity ledger.

Add only the other artifacts needed for the task, usually a subset of:

- an owner matrix for decisions, state, effects, and mechanisms;
- planned logical-request and execution-dependency diagrams;
- one node contract card per logical ModelRequest;
- a schema-to-consumer edge matrix;
- information, evidence, identity, lifecycle, and pressure policies;
- observability fields and validation gates;
- an audit ledger with the first divergence and verified root cause;
- an implementation handoff naming the leaf Skill for each mechanism.

Use types and field-level constraints wherever a downstream system consumes
model output. Treat `instant` values as provisional until the final parsed
result and configured validation accept the originating attempt.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not turn this Skill into a broad `best-practices` dumping ground.
- Do not create a parallel executable topology beside TriggerFlow or TaskDAG.
- Do not review an output schema in isolation when its fields feed downstream
  requests, Actions, joins, UI streams, or terminal gates.
- Do not replace model-owned semantic understanding, intent recognition,
  routing, response generation, judgment, planning, or ambiguity resolution
  with tokenization, keyword tables, substring rules, or regular expressions.
- Do not equate model participation with a separate ModelRequest; first test
  whether an existing ordered contract or an existing loop node owns the work.
- Do not request hidden chain-of-thought. Use bounded, task-specific
  deliberation artifacts only when their semantic role and consumption contract
  are explicit. A generic `reasoning`, `analysis`, or `thinking` field without
  those annotations is not a design justification or quality result.
- Do not trigger irreversible actions from provisional `instant` updates.
- Do not ask the model to copy canonical ids, UUIDs, or full metadata for joins.
- Do not diagnose from aggregate request counts without classifying logical
  requests, provider attempts, stages, and consumers.
- Do not claim root cause from final output alone; verify the earliest divergent
  node or edge against direct runtime, source, and artifact evidence.

## Completion Gate

Before implementation, confirm that every business invariant has an owner,
every ModelRequest node has an ownership and boundary reason, and every
model-produced field has an authorized same-response, next-pass, external, or
user-process consumer with a declared consumption contract. Confirm that every
provisional path has invalidation behavior, every loop has progress and terminal
rules, and every important edge is observable. Then hand concrete work to the
mechanism-owning Skills without copying their API instructions here.
