# commit

You are a careful git commit workflow. Analyze the working tree, group changes by
logical concern, stage deliberately, and create clean Conventional Commits. **Do not
edit files** — this workflow only inspects, stages, and commits.

## Workflow

1. **Inspect git state** (all verified to run — safe, read-only):

   ```bash
   git status --porcelain=v1
   git branch --show-current
   git diff --stat
   git diff
   git diff --cached --stat
   git diff --cached
   git log --oneline -10
   ```

   Stop if there are no staged or unstaged changes.

2. **Classify changes by concern, not by file**:
   - Include untracked files.
   - Split unrelated work into separate proposed commits.
   - Keep dependent infrastructure/config changes before features, fixes, tests, and docs.
   - Flag secrets, `.env` files, credentials, private keys, generated junk, and unrelated
     user changes before staging.

3. **Check branch fit**:
   - Expected format: `<type>/<short-description>` or `<type>/<ISSUE-KEY>-<brief-description>`.
   - Allowed branch types: `feat`, `fix`, `hotfix`, `release`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`,
     `chore`, `perf`, `ci`, `build`, `style`.
   - Branch names are lowercase and hyphenated.
   - If the branch does not match the dominant change, recommend
     `git switch -c <type>/<description>` and wait for confirmation before switching.

4. **Present the commit plan before staging**:
   - Show branch check results first.
   - List each proposed commit with message, scope, included files/hunks, and any risk.
   - Ask for confirmation before staging or committing.

5. **Stage one commit at a time**:
   - Never use `git add .` or `git add -A`.
   - Avoid interactive staging such as `git add -p`.
   - Use `git add <explicit-paths>` for whole-file groups.
   - For partial-file groups, create a temporary patch and apply it with `git apply --cached`.
   - Verify each staged group with `git diff --cached --stat` and `git diff --cached`
     before committing.

6. **Commit format**:

   ```
   <type>(<scope>): <short summary>

   <optional body: what and why, not how>

   <optional footer: BREAKING CHANGE: or issue refs>
   ```

   - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, `style`, `test`, `perf`, `ci`, `build`.
   - Scope: dominant module, package, component, service, or domain.
   - Summary: imperative, lowercase, no period, max 72 characters.
   - Body: wrap near 72 characters when needed.
   - Use `!` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` only for real breaking changes.
   - Never add agent or AI co-author trailers. Omit any `Co-authored-by:` line naming an
     agent, assistant, or bot (e.g. Claude, Copilot, Cursor, `*[bot]`, `noreply@`), and any
     `Generated with` / `🤖` attribution. Keep only co-authors who are real human
     collaborators the user names.

7. **Finish**:
   - Show `git log --oneline -n <number_of_commits>`.
   - Report any skipped changes and why they were not committed.

## Rules

- Do not edit files. This workflow inspects, stages, and commits only.
- Commit only after explicit user confirmation.
- Never switch branches without confirmation.
- Never stage unrelated changes.
- Never commit secrets, credentials, `.env` files, or private keys.
- Never include agent, AI, or bot co-author trailers or attribution in a commit message;
  strip any that would otherwise be added.
- Never amend, rebase, push, or create PRs unless explicitly asked.
- If a hunk is ambiguous, ask before staging it.
- If changes are too unrelated for one branch, recommend separate branches.
- If a commit would be empty, skip it and explain why.
