# symproof internals

## Core philosophy: loosely coupled proofs, not monoliths

symproof is designed for **collective coverage** — many small, focused proofs that each address one property of a system. This is more powerful and more scalable than complex proofs that try to establish everything at once.

A single system should have MANY independent proofs:
- Stability proof (does the system converge?)
- Controllability proof (can we steer it?)
- Observability proof (can we measure it?)
- Invariant proof (is this quantity conserved?)
- Convexity proof (is the optimization well-posed?)

Each proof is sealed independently with its own hash. The hashes go into a **requirements traceability matrix** — each proof hash maps to a specific requirement. A reviewer can verify any proof independently without understanding the others.

Composition via `import_bundle` is for when one property LOGICALLY DEPENDS on another (e.g., uniqueness depends on strict convexity). It is NOT for bundling unrelated properties together. If stability and controllability are independent properties, prove them separately.

**symproof covers the symbolic analysis layer only.** It does not replace simulation (Monte Carlo, HIL) or code verification (static analysis, formal methods). A complete V&V program needs all three layers, with symproof's proof hashes linking the symbolic layer to the requirements alongside simulation results and audit findings.

## Evidence chain

```
AxiomSet → axiom_set_hash
  → Hypothesis (carries axiom_set_hash)
  → ProofScript (carries axiom_set_hash + imported_bundles + lemmas)
    → verify_proof(script) → ProofResult
      → seal(axiom_set, hypothesis, script) → ProofBundle(bundle_hash)
```

`seal()` is the ONLY path to a ProofBundle. It enforces:
1. Axiom hash matches
2. Hypothesis name matches script target
3. Lemma assumptions don't contradict axioms
4. Imported bundles share the same axiom set
5. All lemmas pass verification (imports re-verified, no trust shortcut)
6. Foundation coverage: when `foundations=` is provided, every axiom in each foundation's axiom set must exist in the downstream axiom set (hidden axiom enforcement)
7. No false axioms: `simplify(axiom.expr)` must not be `False` (checked at AxiomSet construction)
8. Pairwise consistency: no two axioms may contradict (checked at seal time, `check_consistency=False` to skip)
9. Load-bearing accounting: symbol constructor assumptions (e.g., `Symbol("x", positive=True)`) that affect lemma verification must be declared as axioms
10. Assumption reporting: every sealed bundle's advisories enumerate all posited, inherited, and external assumptions

## Verification strategies (LemmaKind)

| Kind | Checks | Use when |
|------|--------|----------|
| EQUALITY | `simplify(expr - expected) == 0`, .doit() fallback | Algebraic identities, series, closed forms |
| BOOLEAN | `simplify → refine → proof-by-contradiction` | Implications, inequalities, relational |
| QUERY | `sympy.ask(expr, Q-context)` | Positivity, type predicates (irrational, integer) |
| PROPERTY | `getattr(expr, property_name)` is truthy | Topological/structural properties (is_open, is_closed) |
| INFERENCE | `depends_on` non-empty + `rule` non-empty | Logical conclusions from premises (Heine-Borel, duality) |
| COORDINATE_TRANSFORM | Round-trip + transform + simplify/trigsimp | Polar, hyperbolic, body-frame transforms |

## Advisory system

Results carry `advisories: tuple[str, ...]` when verification passes through known SymPy limitations. Every advisory is a flag for human review — it doesn't mean the proof is wrong, it means an engineer should inspect this step.

## Composition (import_bundle)

Use `import_bundle` ONLY when there is a logical dependency between proofs. The imported bundle's proof is re-verified at seal time.

```python
# YES: uniqueness depends on strong convexity
unique = unique_minimizer(axioms, f, vars, m)  # internally imports strongly_convex

# NO: don't bundle unrelated properties
# Instead: prove stability and controllability SEPARATELY, trace both to requirements
```

## Evaluation control: `unevaluated()` and `evaluation()`

SymPy eagerly evaluates expressions at construction time — `Symbol("x", positive=True) > 0` becomes `True`, losing the structural information. symproof inverts this:

- **`unevaluated()`** — suppress eager evaluation during axiom/expression construction
- **`evaluation()`** — explicit gate around `simplify()`, `ask()`, `refine()`

**Best practice**: always build axiom sets under `unevaluated()`:

```python
from symproof import unevaluated

with unevaluated():
    axioms = AxiomSet(name="system", axioms=(
        Axiom(name="x_pos", expr=x > 0),  # stays structural, not True
    ))
```

All `simplify()`/`ask()`/`refine()` calls in verification.py, bundle.py, tactics.py, and library functions are wrapped in `evaluation()` gates. This makes every evaluation point explicit and auditable.

## Citation and provenance

Inherited axioms must carry a `Citation` for traceability:

```python
from symproof import Citation

Axiom(
    name="bounded_gradient",
    expr=gamma > 0,
    inherited=True,
    citation=Citation(source="Flam 2004, Theorem 2"),
)
```

`Citation` has two fields:
- `source: str` — human-readable reference (required)
- `bundle_hash: str = ""` — optional link to a foundation ProofBundle

## Hidden axioms and foundation enforcement

**The hidden axiom problem is a major cause of failures in applied mathematics.** When a proof cites an external theorem, it inherits that theorem's assumptions. If those assumptions are not explicitly declared and verified for the specific application, the proof has a soundness gap.

Example: a convergence proof cites Flam's stochastic heavy ball theorem. Flam's theorem requires bounded stochastic gradients, a Lipschitz-continuous objective, and Robbins-Monro step sizes. If the downstream proof only declares "Flam's theorem holds" without carrying these conditions, it has three hidden axioms.

### Detection via `seal(foundations=...)`

```python
foundation = make_convergence_bundle()  # proves theorem under its own axioms
bundle = seal(axioms, hypothesis, script,
              foundations=[(foundation, "convergence_theorem")])
# ValueError if foundation.axiom_set has axioms missing from `axioms`
```

### Fixing: inherited axioms

Add the foundation's conditions to the downstream axiom set with `inherited=True`:

```python
Axiom(name="bounded_gradient", expr=gamma > 0, inherited=True,
      citation=Citation(source="Flam 2004, Theorem 2"),
      description="Required by convergence theorem foundation.")
```

`inherited=True` means: "this condition was not a design choice — the proof chain forced it." Both posited and inherited axioms are required for soundness, but the distinction traces provenance. The `citation` is required on all inherited axioms — it records where the condition came from.

### When to use foundations

Use `seal(foundations=...)` whenever:
- An axiom has `expr=sympy.S.true` and a separate proof backs it
- You are building on an external theorem and want to surface its conditions
- You want to ensure the full assumption chain is auditable

See `symproof/library/examples/dip_routing/` for a complete worked example where foundation enforcement revealed 7 hidden axioms across 3 proof pairs.

## Known SymPy limitations

1. **Bounded intervals**: Q-system can't reason about `0 < f < 1 → 1-f > 0`. Workaround: helper symbol `g = 1-f`.
2. **Domain-ignoring simplify**: cancels across singularities. Advisory system flags this.
3. **Piecewise/Max/Min**: not simplified under assumptions. Library workarounds available.
